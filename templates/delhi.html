        <p>
            In this image, we have analyzed 4 things, the distribution of rent in Delhi, distribution of the area of
            houses in Delhi,
            Number of bedrooms in the houses in Delhi and distribution of bathrooms in the houses in Delhi.
            From this figure, we find that the rent of most houses is under 30k rupees, most of the houses in Delhi
            are under 6000 square
            feet in area, most houses in Delhi have 2 or 3 bedrooms and 1 or 2 bathrooms

        <h3>Area</h3>
        <img class="RightAlign" src="static/Spacious/DELHI.png" alt="Delhi-spacious" border="0">
        <p>
            This image shows the most spacious and least spacious localities to live in Delhi. Spaciousness of a
            locality is calculated by
            taking the average of areas of houses in that locality. Most spacious localities are the localities that
            have the highest average area
            of all the houses in that locality and converse is true for the least spacious localities. From this image,
            we see that Bhawani Kunj,Karawal Nagar, South Extension II are the least spacous localities in Delhi
            whereas
            Geetanjali Enclave,South Extension Part 1 and Niti Bagh are the most spacious localities in Delhi

        <img class="LeftAlign" src="static/Affordability/DELHI.png" alt="Aahemdabad-affordability" border="0">
        <p>
            This image shows the most afforable and least afforable localities to live in Delhi. Affordability
            of a locality is calculated by
            taking the average price of all the houses in that locality. Most affordable localities are the
            localities that have the lowest average
            price and the converse is true for least afforable localities. From this image, we see that
            Mukundpur, Gokalpur and Gazipur
            are the most afforable localities in Delhi whereas South Extension II, East Kidwai Nagar and Main Chattarpur Road are the
            least affordable localities
            in Delhi
