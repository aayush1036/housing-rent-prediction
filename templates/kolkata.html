        <h3>Numerical Analysis</h3>

        <p>
            In this image, we have analyzed 4 things, the distribution of rent in Kolkata, distribution of the area of
            houses in Kolkata,
            Number of bedrooms in the houses in Kolkata and distribution of bathrooms in the houses in Kolkata.
            From this figure, we find that the rent of most houses is under 40k rupees, most of the houses in Kolkata
            are under 2000 square
            feet in area, most houses in Kolkata have 2 or 3 bedrooms and 1 or 2 bathrooms

        <h3>Area</h3>
        <img class="RightAlign" src="static/Spacious/KOLKATA.png" alt="Kolkata-spacious" border="0">
        <p>
            This image shows the most spacious and least spacious localities to live in Kolkata. Spaciousness of a
            locality is calculated by
            taking the average of areas of houses in that locality. Most spacious localities are the localities that
            have the highest average area
            of all the houses in that locality and converse is true for the least spacious localities. From this image,
            we see that Banerjee Para Road,Rabindra Sarova Metro, Bhojenrhat are the least spacous localities in Kolkata
            whereas
            Thakurpukur 3A Bus Stand,Kadam Tala,Kona Expressway are the most spacious localities in Kolkata

        <h3>Affordability</h3>
        <img class="LeftAlign" src="static/Affordability/KOLKATA.png" alt="Aahemdabad-affordability" border="0">
        <p>
            This image shows the most afforable and least afforable localities to live in Kolkata. Affordability
            of a locality is calculated by
            taking the average price of all the houses in that locality. Most affordable localities are the
            localities that have the lowest average
            price and the converse is true for least afforable localities. From this image, we see that
            Thakurpukur 3A Bus Stand, Makardah and Durganagar are the most afforable localities in Kolkata whereas 
            Barabazar Market, Shyambazar and Lal Bazar are the least affordable localities in Kolkata
