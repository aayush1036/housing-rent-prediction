<p class="intro">
    Mumbai, the financial capital of India has a perception of being the city of dreams with a fancy night
    life and it is also famous
    the city that never sleeps, but it also has a perception of being an overcrowded and densely populated
    city which leads to scarcity
    of space and hence the houses here are small, We aim to provide you with exact details obtained after
    analysing the data ourselves
    so that you can take an informed decision yourself, good luck with your housing search.

        <p>
            In this image, we have analyzed 4 things, the distribution of rent in Mumbai, distribution of the area of
            houses in Mumbai,
            Number of bedrooms in the houses in Mumbai and distribution of bathrooms in the houses in Mumbai.
            From this figure, we find that the rent of most houses is under 100k rupees, most of the houses in Mumbai
            are under 2000 square
            feet in area, most houses in Mumbai have 1 or 2 bedrooms and 1 or 2 bathrooms

        <h3>Area</h3>
        <img class="RightAlign" src="static/Spacious/MUMBAI.png" alt="Mumbai-spacious" border="0">
        <p>
            This image shows the most spacious and least spacious localities to live in Mumbai. Spaciousness of a
            locality is calculated by
            taking the average of areas of houses in that locality. Most spacious localities are the localities that
            have the highest average area
            of all the houses in that locality and converse is true for the least spacious localities. From this image,
            we see that Joseph Patel Wadi, Nariman Point, Mulund Check Naka are the least spacous localities in Mumbai whereas 
            4 Bungalows, Vasant Vihar, and Samantanagar Thakur Village are the most spacious localities in Mumbai

        <h3>Affordability</h3>
        <img class="LeftAlign" src="static/Affordability/MUMBAI.png" alt="Aahemdabad-affordability" border="0">
        <p>
            This image shows the most afforable and least afforable localities to live in Mumbai. Affordability
            of a locality is calculated by
            taking the average price of all the houses in that locality. Most affordable localities are the
            localities that have the lowest average
            price and the converse is true for least afforable localities. From this image, we see that
            Utan, Vasind and Shelwadi are the most afforable localities in Mumbai whereas 
            Bandstand Road, Mount Marry and Churchgate are the least affordable localities in Mumbai
