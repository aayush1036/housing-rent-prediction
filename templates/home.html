            <h3><a href="{{url_for('mumbai')}}" class="member-link">Mumbai</a></h3>
            <p>Mumbai is the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra. According to the United Nations, as of
                2018, Mumbai is the second-most populous city in the country after Delhi and the seventh-most populous
                city in the world with a population of roughly 20 million. As per the Indian government population
                census of 2011, Mumbai was the most populous city in India with an estimated city proper population of
                12.5 million living under Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. Mumbai is the centre of the Mumbai
                Metropolitan Region, the sixth most populous metropolitan area in the world with a population of over 23
                million. Mumbai lies on the Konkan coast on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour. In
                2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world city. It has the highest number of millionaires and billionaires
                among all cities in India. Mumbai is home to three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Elephanta Caves,
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, and the city's distinctive ensemble of Victorian and Art Deco
                buildings.
                The seven islands that constitute Mumbai were originally home to communities of Marathi language
                speaking Koli people. For centuries, the seven islands of Bombay were under the control of successive
                indigenous rulers before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire, and subsequently to the East India
                Company in 1661, through the dowry of Catherine Braganza when she was married off to Charles II of
                England. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook
                reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea. Along with construction of major roads
                and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the
                Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development.
                During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's
                independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta
                Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.
                Mumbai is the financial, commercial, and the entertainment capital of India. It is also one of the
                world's top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow, generating 6.16% of India's GDP,
                and accounting for 25% of industrial output, 70% of maritime trade in India (Mumbai Port Trust and
                JNPT), and 70% of capital transactions to India's economy. Mumbai has the eighth-highest number of
                billionaires of any city in the world, and Mumbai's billionaires had the highest average wealth of any
                city in the world in 2008. The city houses important financial institutions and the corporate
                headquarters of numerous Indian companies and multinational corporations. It is also home to some of
                India's premier scientific and nuclear institutes. The city is also home to Bollywood and Marathi cinema
                industries. Mumbai's business opportunities attract migrants from all over India.

        <h3><a href="{{url_for('delhi')}}" class="member-link">Delhi</a></h3>
        <p>
            Delhi officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a city and a union territory of India
            containing New Delhi, the capital of India. Located on the Yamuna river, Delhi is bordered by the state of
            Haryana on three sides and by Uttar Pradesh to the east. The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres
            (573 sq mi). According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million, while the
            NCT's population was about 16.8 million. Delhi's urban agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities of
            Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida in an area known as the National Capital Region (NCR), has an
            estimated population of over 28 million, making it the largest metropolitan area in India and the
            second-largest in the world. Recent estimates of the metropolitan economy of its urban area have ranked
            Delhi either the most or second-most productive city of India. Delhi is the second-wealthiest city in India
            (after Mumbai), and is home to 18 billionaires and 23,000 millionaires. Delhi ranks fifth among the Indian
            states and union territories in human development index. Delhi has the second-highest GDP per capita in
            India (after Goa).Delhi is of great historical significance as an important commercial, transport, and
            cultural hub, as well as the political centre of India.
            During the Vedic period, Delhi was the site of Indraprastha or Indrapat, an Indo-Aryan city which served as
            a capital of the Kuru Kingdom, the first state-level society in the Indian subcontinent. The city later
            served as a capital of various other kingdoms and empires, including the Hindu Tomaras and the Muslim Delhi
            Sultanate and Mughal Empire. It has been captured, ransacked and rebuilt several times, and modern Delhi is
            a cluster of a number of cities spread across the metropolitan region. For many centuries, Delhi has been a
            dominant trading and commercial centre in North India, and since the 1990s it has emerged as an important
            node in the international corporate and financial network.
            Although a union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles
            that of a state of India, with its own legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed
            by a Chief Minister. New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and the local
            government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. Delhi hosted the
            inaugural 1951 Asian Games, 1982 Asian Games, 1983 NAM Summit, 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, 2010
            Commonwealth Games, 2012 BRICS Summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup.
            Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region (NCR), which is a unique 'interstate regional
            planning' area created by the National Capital Region Planning Board Act of 1985.

        <h3><a href="{{url_for('kolkata')}}" class="member-link">Kolkata</a></h3>
        <p>Kolkata is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal. Located on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River,
            the city is approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) west of the border with Bangladesh. It is the primary
            business, commercial, and financial hub of Eastern India and the main port of communication for North-East
            India. According to the 2011 Indian census, Kolkata is the seventh-most populous city in India, with a
            population of 4.5 million residents within the city limits, and a population of over 14.1 million residents
            in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area. It is the third-most populous metropolitan area in India. In 2021, Kolkata
            metropolitan area crossed 15 million registered voters. The Port of Kolkata is India's oldest operating port
            and its sole major riverine port. Kolkata is regarded as the Cultural Capital of India.
            In the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under
            Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690, the area was
            developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post known as Fort William. Nawab Siraj
            ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following year. In 1793 the
            East India company was strong enough to abolish native rule, and assumed full sovereignty of the region.
            Under the company rule and later under the British Raj, Calcutta served as the capital of British-held
            territories in India until 1911. At that time, the British assessed its perceived geographical
            disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in Bengal, and moved the capital to New Delhi. Calcutta was
            the centre for the Indian independence movement.
            Following independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the centre of Indian commerce, culture, and
            politics, suffered many decades of political violence and economic stagnation. A demographically diverse
            city, the culture of Kolkata features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively close-knit neighbourhoods
            (paras) and freestyle conversations (adda). Kolkata is home to West Bengal's film industry Tollywood and
            cultural institutions, such as the Academy of Fine Arts, the Victoria Memorial, the Asiatic Society, the
            Indian Museum, and the National Library of India. Among scientific institutions, Kolkata hosts the Agri
            Horticultural Society of India, the Geological Survey of India, the Botanical Survey of India, the Calcutta
            Mathematical Society, the Indian Science Congress Association, the Zoological Survey of India, the
            Institution of Engineers, the Anthropological Survey of India and the Indian Public Health Association. Four
            Nobel laureates and two Nobel Memorial Prize winners are associated with the city. Though home to major
            cricketing venues and franchises, Kolkata differs from other Indian cities by focusing on association
            football and other sports.

        <h3><a href="{{url_for('bangalore')}}" class="member-link">Bangalore</a></h3>
        <p>
            Bangalore, is the capital and the largest city of the Indian state of Karnataka. It has a population of more
            than 8 million and a metropolitan population of around 11 million, making it the third most populous city
            and fifth most populous urban agglomeration in India. Located in southern India on the Deccan Plateau, at a
            height of over 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level, Bangalore is known for its pleasant climate throughout the
            year. Its elevation is the highest among the major cities of India.
            The city's history dates back to around 890 CE, in a stone inscription found at the Nageshwara Temple in
            Begur, Bangalore. The Begur inscription is written in Halegannada (ancient Kannada), mentions 'Bengaluru
            Kalaga' (battle of Bengaluru). It was a significant turning point in the history of Bangalore as it bears
            the earliest reference to the name 'Bengaluru'. In 1537 CE, Kempé Gowdā – a feudal ruler under the
            Vijayanagara Empire – established a mud fort considered to be the foundation of modern Bangalore and its
            oldest areas, or petes, which exist to the present day. After the fall of Vijayanagar empire in 16th
            century, the Mughals sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar (1673–1704), the then ruler of the Kingdom of
            Mysore for three lakh rupees. When Haider Ali seized control of the Kingdom of Mysore, the administration of
            Bangalore passed into his hands.
            The city was captured by the British East India Company after victory in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799),
            who returned administrative control of the city to the Maharaja of Mysore. The old city developed in the
            dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore and was made capital of the Princely State of Mysore, which existed as a
            nominally sovereign entity of the British Raj. In 1809, the British shifted their cantonment to Bangalore,
            outside the old city, and a town grew up around it, which was governed as part of British India. Following
            India's independence in 1947, Bangalore became the capital of Mysore State, and remained capital when the
            new Indian state of Karnataka was formed in 1956. The two urban settlements of Bangalore – city and
            cantonment – which had developed as independent entities merged into a single urban centre in 1949. The
            existing Kannada name, Bengalūru, was declared the official name of the city in 2006.
            Bangalore is widely regarded as the "Silicon Valley of India" (or "IT capital of India") because of its role
            as the nation's leading information technology (IT) exporter. Indian technological organisations are
            headquartered in the city. A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is the second fastest-growing major
            metropolis in India. Recent estimates of the metro economy of its urban area have ranked Bangalore either
            the fourth- or fifth-most productive metro area of India. As of 2017, Bangalore was home to 7,700
            millionaires and 8 billionaires with a total wealth of $320 billion. It is home to many educational and
            research institutions. Numerous state-owned aerospace and defence organisations are located in the city. The
            city also houses the Kannada film industry. It was ranked the most liveable Indian city with a population of
            over a million under the Ease of Living Index 2020.

            the north of the city centre. According to the 2011 Census of India, Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous
            city in India with a population of 6.9 million residents within the city limits, and has a population of 9.7
            million residents in the metropolitan region, making it the sixth-most populous metropolitan area in India.

            Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah established Hyderabad in 1591 to extend the capital beyond the fortified Golconda.
            In 1687, the city was annexed by the Mughals. In 1724, Mughal Viceroy Nizam Asaf Jah I declared his
            sovereignty and founded the Asaf Jahi dynasty, also known as the Nizams. Hyderabad served as the imperial
            capital of the Asaf Jahis from 1769 to 1948. As capital of the princely state of Hyderabad, the city housed
            the British Residency and cantonment until Indian independence in 1947. Hyderabad was annexed by the Indian
            Union in 1948 and continued as a capital of Hyderabad State (1948–56). After the introduction of the States
            Reorganisation Act of 1956, Hyderabad was made the capital of the newly formed Andhra Pradesh. In 2014,
            Andhra Pradesh was bifurcated to form Telangana and Hyderabad became the joint capital of the two states
            with a transitional arrangement scheduled to end in 2024. Since 1956, the city has housed the winter office
            of the President of India.
            Relics of the Qutb Shahi and Nizam rules remain visible today; the Charminar has come to symbolise the city.
            By the end of early modern era, the Mughal Empire declined in the Deccan and the Nizam's patronage had
            attracted men of letters from various parts of the world. The amalgamation of local and migrated artisans
            had originated a distinctive culture, and the city emerged as a significant centre of oriental culture.
            Painting, handicraft, jewellery, literature, dialect and clothing are prominent still today. Through its
            cuisine, the city is listed as a UNESCO creative city of gastronomy. The Telugu film industry based in the
            city was the country's second-largest producer of motion pictures as of 2012.
            Until the 19th century Hyderabad was known for the pearl industry and was nicknamed the "City of Pearls",
            and was the only Golconda Diamonds trading centre in the world. Many of the city's historical and
            traditional bazaars remain open. Hyderabad's central location between the Deccan Plateau and the Western
            Ghats, and industrialisation throughout the 20th century attracted major Indian research, manufacturing,
            educational and financial institutions. Since the 1990s, the city has emerged as an Indian hub of
            pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. The formation of special economic zones and HITEC City dedicated to
            information technology has encouraged leading multinationals to set up operations in Hyderabad.
